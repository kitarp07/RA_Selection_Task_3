# Task III – Feature Extraction and Similarity Analysis from 3D Knee CT

This project involves extracting deep feature representations from three anatomical regions of a 3D knee CT scan—**tibia**, **femur**, and **background**—using a converted 3D version of the pretrained 2D DenseNet121 architecture. Cosine similarity scores are computed between region pairs to analyze representational similarity across different convolutional depths.
